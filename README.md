Howdy, this is a repository for all of the custom card scripts that I made during my free time.
Do note that while it is true that I scripted these cards, they are not my brainchild and instead are my friends' brainchild.

Rayda Revolt
1. Tea Party archetype
- A custom archetype based on a group from Blue Archive.
- The archetype recycles their activated spells and traps back into the deck.
- The archetype focuses on controlling the board by sending cards back to the deck and flipping monsters facedown.
